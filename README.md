[AllWebSD.com](https://www.allwebsd.com) Season 6 demos on data structures with a mighty morphin twist.

The goal for this series was to deconstruct lessons learned from going head first into data structures. It‚Äôs my hope that I can translate a complex topic into an easy-going format and I did so by channeling my inner 10-year-old self. You see back in my day, I was a big fan of the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series. So I went ahead and took snapshots from that show and brushed it with some code.

# Episodes

## üì∫ [Episode 01](https://marklreyes.com/blog/mighty-morphin-data-structures-part-1/)
Zordon and Alpha assemble the team considering two data structures - a linked list or an array.

## üì∫ [Episode 02](https://marklreyes.com/blog/mighty-morphin-data-structures-part-2/)
Extending on the idea of an array, Zordon assigns each ordinary teen their power.

## üì∫ [Episode 03](https://marklreyes.com/blog/mighty-morphin-data-structures-part-3/)
Rita sends down Goldar and the Putties. It's time to queue up our plan of attack.

## üì∫ [Episode 04](https://marklreyes.com/blog/mighty-morphin-data-structures-part-4/)
We must prioritize the queue as things quickly change when Rita throws her magic wand down from the moon.

## üì∫ [Episode 05](https://marklreyes.com/blog/mighty-morphin-data-structures-part-5/)
We need DinoZord power now! Assembling MegaZord by way of a stack data structure.
